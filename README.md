# macOS Scripts by Adam Baali

This repository is a collection of lightweight, MDM-agnostic scripts designed to solve real-world problems on macOS.

The focus is on simplicity, portability, and practical use in enterprise environments. These scripts are modular and adaptable — useful whether you're managing devices with Jamf, Intune, Kandji, or just need something standalone.

## Why This Exists

MDM tools don’t always handle timing, app behavior, or edge cases well — and sometimes scripting is the cleanest way to get something done reliably.

These scripts are here to help with that.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork, adapt, and use as needed. PRs welcome for anything that’s proven and useful.
