# macOS Scripts by Adam Baali

This repository is a collection of lightweight, MDM-agnostic scripts designed to solve real-world problems on macOS.

The focus is on simplicity, portability, and practical use in enterprise environments. These scripts are modular and adaptable useful whether you're managing devices with Jamf, Intune, Kandji, or just need something standalone.

## Why This Exists

MDM tools don’t always handle timing, app behavior, or edge cases well and sometimes scripting is the cleanest way to get something done reliably.

These scripts are here to help with that.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork, adapt, and use as needed. PRs welcome for anything that’s proven and useful.
